      <h4 class="service-heading">Chief Data Officer</h4>
      <p>Despite starting off at art school, Regina would very much like to avoid front end whenever possible. When she’s not coding, she spends her time crocheting increasingly more ridiculous hats and scarves that look like food. She thinks beaches are vastly overrated, except for dog beaches which cannot possibly be overrated because as we all know, dogs are amazing.</p>

      <h3 class="service-heading">Alfie</h3>
      <h4 class="service-heading">Chief Happiness Officer</h4>
      <p>Alfie is a good boy. As Chief Happiness Officer, he has the very important job of minimizing the amount of sadness the team experiences. He is an expert in licking faces, giving handshakes, snuggling, and looking cute. He enjoys long walks on the beach as long as you don’t ask him to get in the water.</p>
